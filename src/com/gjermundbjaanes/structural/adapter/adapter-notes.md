# Concepts

* Plug adaptor (physical metaphor)
* Convert interface into another interface
* Legacy
* Translates requests
* Client, Adapter, Adaptee
* Examples
    * Arrays -> Lists
    * Streams


# Design

* Client centric
* Integrate new with old
* Interface, but not required
* Adaptee can be the implementation


# Pitfalls

* Not a lot!
* Don't overcomplicate them
* Multiple Adapters (you might want that)
* Don't add functionality


# Contrast

Adapter
* Works after code is designed
* Legacy
* Retrofitted
* Provides different interface

Bridge
* Designed upfront
* Abstraction and implementation vary
* Built in advance
* Both adapt multiple systems
